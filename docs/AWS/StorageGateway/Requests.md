#### `resetCache`

``` purescript
resetCache :: forall eff. Service -> ResetCacheInput -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) ResetCacheOutput
```

<p>Resets all cache disks that have encountered a error and makes the disks available for reconfiguration as cache storage. If your cache disk encounters a error, the gateway prevents read and write operations on virtual tapes in the gateway. For example, an error can occur when a disk is corrupted or removed from the gateway. When a cache is reset, the gateway loses its cache storage. At this point you can reconfigure the disks as cache disks. This operation is only supported in the cached volume and tape types.</p> <important> <p>If the cache disk you are resetting contains data that has not been uploaded to Amazon S3 yet, that data can be lost. After you reset cache disks, there will be no configured cache disks left in the gateway, so you must configure at least one new cache disk for your gateway to function properly.</p> </important>

#### `retrieveTapeArchive`

``` purescript
retrieveTapeArchive :: forall eff. Service -> RetrieveTapeArchiveInput -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) RetrieveTapeArchiveOutput

<p>Retrieves the recovery point for the specified virtual tape. This operation is only supported in the tape gateway type.</p> <p>A recovery point is a point in time view of a virtual tape at which all the data on the tape is consistent. If your gateway crashes, virtual tapes that have recovery points can be recovered to a new gateway.</p> <note> <p>The virtual tape can be retrieved to only one gateway. The retrieved tape is read-only. The virtual tape can be retrieved to only a tape gateway. There is no charge for retrieving recovery points.</p> </note>

#### `setLocalConsolePassword`

``` purescript
setLocalConsolePassword :: forall eff. Service -> SetLocalConsolePasswordInput -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) SetLocalConsolePasswordOutput
```

<p>Sets the password for your VM local console. When you log in to the local console for the first time, you log in to the VM with the default credentials. We recommend that you set a new password. You don't need to know the default password to set a new password.</p>

#### `shutdownGateway`

``` purescript
shutdownGateway :: forall eff. Service -> ShutdownGatewayInput -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) ShutdownGatewayOutput
```

<p>Shuts down a gateway. To specify which gateway to shut down, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in the body of your request.</p> <p>The operation shuts down the gateway service component running in the gateway's virtual machine (VM) and not the host VM.</p> <note> <p>If you want to shut down the VM, it is recommended that you first shut down the gateway component in the VM to avoid unpredictable conditions.</p> </note> <p>After the gateway is shutdown, you cannot call any other API except <a>StartGateway</a>, <a>DescribeGatewayInformation</a>, and <a>ListGateways</a>. For more information, see <a>ActivateGateway</a>. Your applications cannot read from or write to the gateway's storage volumes, and there are no snapshots taken.</p> <note> <p>When you make a shutdown request, you will get a <code>200 OK</code> success response immediately. However, it might take some time for the gateway to shut down. You can call the <a>DescribeGatewayInformation</a> API to check the status. For more information, see <a>ActivateGateway</a>.</p> </note> <p>If do not intend to use the gateway again, you must delete the gateway (using <a>DeleteGateway</a>) to no longer pay software charges associated with the gateway.</p>

#### `startGateway`

``` purescript
startGateway :: forall eff. Service -> StartGatewayInput -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) StartGatewayOutput
```

<p>Starts a gateway that you previously shut down (see <a>ShutdownGateway</a>). After the gateway starts, you can then make other API calls, your applications can read from or write to the gateway's storage volumes and you will be able to take snapshot backups.</p> <note> <p>When you make a request, you will get a 200 OK success response immediately. However, it might take some time for the gateway to be ready. You should call <a>DescribeGatewayInformation</a> and check the status before making any additional API calls. For more information, see <a>ActivateGateway</a>.</p> </note> <p>To specify which gateway to start, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in your request.</p>

#### `updateBandwidthRateLimit`

``` purescript
updateBandwidthRateLimit :: forall eff. Service -> UpdateBandwidthRateLimitInput -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) UpdateBandwidthRateLimitOutput
```

<p>Updates the bandwidth rate limits of a gateway. You can update both the upload and download bandwidth rate limit or specify only one of the two. If you don't set a bandwidth rate limit, the existing rate limit remains.</p> <p>By default, a gateway's bandwidth rate limits are not set. If you don't set any limit, the gateway does not have any limitations on its bandwidth usage and could potentially use the maximum available bandwidth.</p> <p>To specify which gateway to update, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in your request.</p>

#### `updateChapCredentials`

``` purescript
updateChapCredentials :: forall eff. Service -> UpdateChapCredentialsInput -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) UpdateChapCredentialsOutput
```

<p>Updates the Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) credentials for a specified iSCSI target. By default, a gateway does not have CHAP enabled; however, for added security, you might use it.</p> <important> <p>When you update CHAP credentials, all existing connections on the target are closed and initiators must reconnect with the new credentials.</p> </important>

#### `updateGatewayInformation`

``` purescript
updateGatewayInformation :: forall eff. Service -> UpdateGatewayInformationInput -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) UpdateGatewayInformationOutput
```

<p>Updates a gateway's metadata, which includes the gateway's name and time zone. To specify which gateway to update, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in your request.</p> <note> <p>For Gateways activated after September 2, 2015, the gateway's ARN contains the gateway ID rather than the gateway name. However, changing the name of the gateway has no effect on the gateway's ARN.</p> </note>

#### `updateGatewaySoftwareNow`

``` purescript
updateGatewaySoftwareNow :: forall eff. Service -> UpdateGatewaySoftwareNowInput -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) UpdateGatewaySoftwareNowOutput
```

<p>Updates the gateway virtual machine (VM) software. The request immediately triggers the software update.</p> <note> <p>When you make this request, you get a <code>200 OK</code> success response immediately. However, it might take some time for the update to complete. You can call <a>DescribeGatewayInformation</a> to verify the gateway is in the <code>STATE_RUNNING</code> state.</p> </note> <important> <p>A software update forces a system restart of your gateway. You can minimize the chance of any disruption to your applications by increasing your iSCSI Initiators' timeouts. For more information about increasing iSCSI Initiator timeouts for Windows and Linux, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/ConfiguringiSCSIClientInitiatorWindowsClient.html#CustomizeWindowsiSCSISettings">Customizing Your Windows iSCSI Settings</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/ConfiguringiSCSIClientInitiatorRedHatClient.html#CustomizeLinuxiSCSISettings">Customizing Your Linux iSCSI Settings</a>, respectively.</p> </important>

#### `updateMaintenanceStartTime`

``` purescript
updateMaintenanceStartTime :: forall eff. Service -> UpdateMaintenanceStartTimeInput -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) UpdateMaintenanceStartTimeOutput
```

<p>Updates a gateway's weekly maintenance start time information, including day and time of the week. The maintenance time is the time in your gateway's time zone.</p>

#### `updateNFSFileShare`

``` purescript
updateNFSFileShare :: forall eff. Service -> UpdateNFSFileShareInput -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) UpdateNFSFileShareOutput
```

<p>Updates a file share. This operation is only supported in the file gateway type.</p> <note> <p>To leave a file share field unchanged, set the corresponding input field to null.</p> </note> <p>Updates the following file share setting:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Default storage class for your S3 bucket</p> </li> <li> <p>Metadata defaults for your S3 bucket</p> </li> <li> <p>Allowed NFS clients for your file share</p> </li> <li> <p>Squash settings</p> </li> <li> <p>Write status of your file share</p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>To leave a file share field unchanged, set the corresponding input field to null. This operation is only supported in file gateways.</p> </note>

#### `updateSnapshotSchedule`

``` purescript
updateSnapshotSchedule :: forall eff. Service -> UpdateSnapshotScheduleInput -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) UpdateSnapshotScheduleOutput
```

<p>Updates a snapshot schedule configured for a gateway volume. This operation is only supported in the cached volume and stored volume gateway types.</p> <p>The default snapshot schedule for volume is once every 24 hours, starting at the creation time of the volume. You can use this API to change the snapshot schedule configured for the volume.</p> <p>In the request you must identify the gateway volume whose snapshot schedule you want to update, and the schedule information, including when you want the snapshot to begin on a day and the frequency (in hours) of snapshots.</p>

#### `updateVTLDeviceType`

``` purescript
updateVTLDeviceType :: forall eff. Service -> UpdateVTLDeviceTypeInput -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) UpdateVTLDeviceTypeOutput
```

<p>Updates the type of medium changer in a tape gateway. When you activate a tape gateway, you select a medium changer type for the tape gateway. This operation enables you to select a different type of medium changer after a tape gateway is activated. This operation is only supported in the tape gateway type.</p>
