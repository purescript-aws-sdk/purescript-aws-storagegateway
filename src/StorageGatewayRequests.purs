In response, the gateway creates the volume and returns information about it. This information includes the volume Amazon Resource Name (ARN), its size, and the iSCSI target ARN that initiators can use to connect to the volume target.</p> <p>Optionally, you can provide the ARN for an existing volume as the <code>SourceVolumeARN</code> for this cached volume, which creates an exact copy of the existing volumeâ€™s latest recovery point.

-- | <p>Initiates a snapshot of a volume.</p> <p>AWS Storage Gateway provides the ability to back up point-in-time snapshots of your data to Amazon Simple Storage (S3) for durable off-site recovery, as well as import the data to an Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). You can take snapshots of your gateway volume on a scheduled or ad-hoc basis. This API enables you to take ad-hoc snapshot. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/managing-volumes.html#SchedulingSnapshot">Editing a Snapshot Schedule</a>.</p> <p>In the CreateSnapshot request you identify the volume by providing its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You must also provide description for the snapshot. When AWS Storage Gateway takes the snapshot of specified volume, the snapshot and description appears in the AWS Storage Gateway Console. In response, AWS Storage Gateway returns you a snapshot ID. You can use this snapshot ID to check the snapshot progress or later use it when you want to create a volume from a snapshot. This operation is only supported in stored and cached volume gateway type.</p> <note> <p>To list or delete a snapshot, you must use the Amazon EC2 API. For more information, see DescribeSnapshots or DeleteSnapshot in the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html">EC2 API reference</a>.</p> </note> <important> <p>Volume and snapshot IDs are changing to a longer length ID format.

-- | <p>Initiates a snapshot of a gateway from a volume recovery point. This operation is only supported in the cached volume gateway type.</p> <p>A volume recovery point is a point in time at which all data of the volume is consistent and from which you can create a snapshot. To get a list of volume recovery point for cached volume gateway, use <a>ListVolumeRecoveryPoints</a>.</p> <p>In the <code>CreateSnapshotFromVolumeRecoveryPoint</code> request, you identify the volume by providing its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You must also provide a description for the snapshot. When the gateway takes a snapshot of the specified volume, the snapshot and its description appear in the AWS Storage Gateway console. In response, the gateway returns you a snapshot ID.

A volume recovery point is a point in time at which all data of the volume is consistent and from which you can create a snapshot or clone a new cached volume from a source volume.

-- | <p>Sends you notification through CloudWatch Events when all files written to your NFS file share have been uploaded to Amazon S3.</p> <p>AWS Storage Gateway can send a notification through Amazon CloudWatch Events when all files written to your file share up to that point in time have been uploaded to Amazon S3. These files include files written to the NFS file share up to the time that you make a request for notification. When the upload is done, Storage Gateway sends you notification through an Amazon CloudWatch Event. You can configure CloudWatch Events to send the notification through event targets such as Amazon SNS or AWS Lambda function. This operation is only supported in the file gateway type.</p> <p>For more information, see Getting File Upload Notification in the Storage Gateway User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/monitoring-file-gateway.html#get-upload-notification). </p>

-- | <p>Resets all cache disks that have encountered a error and makes the disks available for reconfiguration as cache storage. If your cache disk encounters a error, the gateway prevents read and write operations on virtual tapes in the gateway. For example, an error can occur when a disk is corrupted or removed from the gateway. When a cache is reset, the gateway loses its cache storage. At this point you can reconfigure the disks as cache disks. This operation is only supported in the cached volume and tape types.</p> <important> <p>If the cache disk you are resetting contains data that has not been uploaded to Amazon S3 yet, that data can be lost. After you reset cache disks, there will be no configured cache disks left in the gateway, so you must configure at least one new cache disk for your gateway to function properly.</p> </important>

This operation is only supported in the tape gateway type.</p> <p>Once a tape is successfully retrieved to a gateway, it cannot be retrieved again to another gateway.

If your gateway crashes, virtual tapes that have recovery points can be recovered to a new gateway.</p> <note> <p>The virtual tape can be retrieved to only one gateway. The retrieved tape is read-only. The virtual tape can be retrieved to only a tape gateway. There is no charge for retrieving recovery points.</p> </note>

-- | <p>Shuts down a gateway. To specify which gateway to shut down, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in the body of your request.</p> <p>The operation shuts down the gateway service component running in the gateway's virtual machine (VM) and not the host VM.</p> <note> <p>If you want to shut down the VM, it is recommended that you first shut down the gateway component in the VM to avoid unpredictable conditions.</p> </note> <p>After the gateway is shutdown, you cannot call any other API except <a>StartGateway</a>, <a>DescribeGatewayInformation</a>, and <a>ListGateways</a>. For more information, see <a>ActivateGateway</a>. Your applications cannot read from or write to the gateway's storage volumes, and there are no snapshots taken.</p> <note> <p>When you make a shutdown request, you will get a <code>200 OK</code> success response immediately. However, it might take some time for the gateway to shut down. You can call the <a>DescribeGatewayInformation</a> API to check the status.

-- | <p>Updates the bandwidth rate limits of a gateway. You can update both the upload and download bandwidth rate limit or specify only one of the two. If you don't set a bandwidth rate limit, the existing rate limit remains.</p> <p>By default, a gateway's bandwidth rate limits are not set. If you don't set any limit, the gateway does not have any limitations on its bandwidth usage and could potentially use the maximum available bandwidth.</p> <p>To specify which gateway to update, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in your request.</p>

-- | <p>Updates the Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) credentials for a specified iSCSI target.

-- | <p>Updates a gateway's metadata, which includes the gateway's name and time zone. To specify which gateway to update, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in your request.</p> <note> <p>For Gateways activated after September 2, 2015, the gateway's ARN contains the gateway ID rather than the gateway name. However, changing the name of the gateway has no effect on the gateway's ARN.</p> </note>

-- | <p>Updates the gateway virtual machine (VM) software. The request immediately triggers the software update.</p> <note> <p>When you make this request, you get a <code>200 OK</code> success response immediately. However, it might take some time for the update to complete. You can call <a>DescribeGatewayInformation</a> to verify the gateway is in the <code>STATE_RUNNING</code> state.</p> </note> <important> <p>A software update forces a system restart of your gateway. You can minimize the chance of any disruption to your applications by increasing your iSCSI Initiators' timeouts.
